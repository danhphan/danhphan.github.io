Hi, my name is Danh Phan. I am passionate in **machine learning** and **data engineering**. My goal are to build data pipelines and develop data-driven products to solve real-world problems, and to help businesses make efficient science-based decisions.

<p class="text-center"> <a href="https://danhphan.net/projects/" class="btn btn--info">Portfolio</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danhpt" class="btn btn--info">LinkedIn</a> <a href="https://danhphan.net/resume/" class="btn btn--info">Resume</a> </p>

Working at the Pacific service team, [Johnson Controls Australia](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/en_au), my tasks involve bulding **data pipelines**, developing **Dynamic Pricing** Models, modelling Customer **churning risks** on Microsoft Azure, as well as performing data analysis and building various KPI reports and BI dashboards.

I am experienced in programming, and have been a **Data instructor** at [Monash Data Fluency](https://www.monash.edu/data-fluency/home), where I teach hands-on data-related workshops with **Python, Git, Bash**, and High-Performance Computing to research students and staff at Monash University. I love Bayesian statistics, and actively contribute to open-source projects like **[PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pulls?q=danhphan)** and **[Aesara](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adanhphan)** on GitHub. I've worked on a **Google Summer of Code** [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/lKwZ8APE) where I develop a module that supports *Multi-output Gaussian Processes* in PyMC.

I am also a PhD **researcher** at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/its), working on **Machine learning** for intelligent transport systems. This research focuses on understanding people's **choice behaviors** when selecting their activity locations and travel modes. In this research, I applied various Machine learning methods (Bayesian methods, choice models, tree-based, and deep neural networks) with econometrics modeling approaches.
