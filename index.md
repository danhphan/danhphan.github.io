Hi, my name is Danh Phan. I am obssess with driving meaningsfull insight from data. 

I'm currently working for the Pacific service team at [Johnson Controls Australia](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/en_au) in Melbourne, as a **Data Scientist**. My tasks involve developing Dynamic Pricing Models; Margin and Conversion rate optimisation; Customer churn modelling on Microsoft Azure; Performing data analysis and building various KPIs and BI dashboards.

I am a PhD candidate at Monash University working on Machine learning for intelligent transport systems. This project focus on understand the user choice behavior when select their activity locations and travel modes. 

My name is Danh Phan, a PhD candidate at Monash University, Australia. My research topic focuses on Machine learning (Bayesian methods, choice models, tree-based, and deep neural networks) for intelligent transport systems. 

I have more than four years experience working on different machine learning algorithms, and have published several papers in the machine learning field. For example, one of my papers that implements different machine learning methods for housing price prediction was published at the 2018 International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Engineering.

I am experienced in Python, and have been an instructor at Monash Data Fluency, where I teach hand-one workshops on Python, Git, and High-Performance Computing to research students and staff at Monash University. I have been working with Bayesian methods in PyMC for more than a year. With the great support from the PyMC dev team, I have recently contributed several pull requests (PRs) to pymc and aesara github codebase

*As a problem-solving enthusiast, I have always been eager to meet new technical challenges, where I can learn some new things and feed my curiosity.  
I got myself into Data Science early in my education and had the chance to get my hands on all kinds of data, from sequential to spatial, images, audio signals, BI data etc.  
As an R&D Engineer, I love to put forward my technical and analytical skills, tackle original problems and learn every day.*

You can check about my different projects on my [projects page](https://danhphan.github.io/projects/)

I want to be an effective Data Scientist who can develop data-driven products to solve real-world problems and help businesses make efficient science-based decisions. I see that the Bayesian method is an intuitive and practical way to solve various issues, especially the ones that need to account for uncertainty. Indeed we also need other machine learning methods, and it will depend on specific use cases.
