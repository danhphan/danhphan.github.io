Hi, my name is Danh Phan. I am passionate in turning data into actionable insights. My goal is to develop data-driven products to solve real-world problems and to help businesses make efficient science-based decisions.

<p class="text-center"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/resume/" class="btn btn--info">Resume</a> <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/projects/" class="btn btn--info">Portfolio</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danhpt" class="btn btn--info">LinkedIn</a></p>

I'm currently working as a **Data Scientist** at the Pacific service team, [Johnson Controls Australia](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/en_au). My tasks involve developing Dynamic Pricing Models; Margin and Conversion rate optimisation; Customer churn modelling on Microsoft Azure; Performing data analysis and building various KPIs and BI dashboards.

I am also a PhD candidate at Monash University working on Machine learning for intelligent transport systems. This project focus on understand the user choice behavior when select their activity locations and travel modes. In this project, I applied various Machine learning methods (Bayesian methods, choice models, tree-based, and deep neural networks) with econometics modelling approaches. 

I am experienced in Python, and have been an instructor at Monash Data Fluency, where I teach hand-one workshops on Python, Git, and High-Performance Computing to research students and staff at Monash University. I have been working with Bayesian methods in PyMC for more than a year. With the great support from the PyMC dev team, I have recently contributed several pull requests (PRs) to pymc and aesara github codebase.
