Danh is building the **data engineering platform** for the Investment Data System Team at [HESTA](https://www.hesta.com.au/about-us), a Super Fund with billions under management and more than 1 million Australian members. Before that, Danh worked at the Pacific service team, [Johnson Controls Australia](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/en_au), his tasks involved building **data pipelines**, developing and productionizing **Dynamic Pricing** models, modelling Customer **churning risks** on cloud, as well as performing data analysis and creating high-quality BI reports and KPI dashboards.

Danh has experience in programming, and has been a **Data instructor** at [Monash Data Fluency](https://www.monash.edu/data-fluency/home), where he teaches hands-on data-related workshops with **Python, Git, Bash**, and High-Performance Computing to research students and staff at Monash University. He loves Data Analytics and Machine Learning, and actively contributes to open-source projects like **[PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/pulls?q=danhphan)** and **[Aesara](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adanhphan)** on GitHub.

Danh was a Ph.D. researcher at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/its), working on **Machine learning** for intelligent transport systems. This research focuses on understanding people's **choice behaviors** when selecting their activity locations and travel modes. In this research, he applied various Machine learning methods (Bayesian methods, choice models, tree-based, and deep neural networks) with econometrics modeling approaches. Before that, he was a **software developer** and worked for several organisations in Vietnam.
