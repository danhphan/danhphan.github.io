## Machine Learning

### Multi-output Gaussian Processes in PyMC 

Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) have recently become an active research topic in machine learning’s multi-task learning. The advantage of multi-output GPs is its capacity to simultaneously learn and infer many outputs which have the same source of uncertainty from inputs. 

This project aims to add support for multi-output GPs in PyMC. This feature would significantly extend the capabilities of this important module, and benefit the PyMC community.

### Customers persona clustering

The goal of this application is to identify the critical groups of users. It will categorise users into different segmentations and try to map these groups with existing Personas.
The dataset, which is Google Analytics data of a website in the last 12 months, has more than billion rows and hundred columns. 
In this application, I have applied SQL and Pandas for data preparation, Matplotlib for data exploration, and ScikitLearn package in Python for building models.
