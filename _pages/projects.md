### Customers persona clustering

The goal of this application is to identify the critical groups of users. It will categorise users into different segmentations and try to map these groups with existing Personas.
The dataset, which is Google Analytics data of a website in the last 12 months, has more than billion rows and hundred columns. 
In this application, I have applied SQL and Pandas for data preparation, Matplotlib for data exploration, and ScikitLearn package in Python for building models.
